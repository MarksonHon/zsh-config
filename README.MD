Install packages from brew:

```bash
brew install zsh-autosuggestions \
             zsh-syntax-highlighting \
             zsh-history-substring-search \
             zsh-fast-syntax-highlighting \
             oh-my-posh
```

Then copy zshrc to your ~/.zshrc, for better look, you can install some nerd fonts from oh-my-posh:

```bash
oh-my-posh font install
```
